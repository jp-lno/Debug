# Project Title

This project allows running scripts based on the target environment using a bash command line interface (CLI). The scripts are named like `run_INT.sh`.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* You have installed [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), the package manager for JavaScript.
* You have a `<Windows/Linux/Mac>` machine. State which OS is supported/required.

## How to Run the Script

Here are step-by-step instructions on how to run the script:

1. Place your 'collection.json', 'environment.json' and 'sequence.csv' files in a version folder named 'v1'.
2. To run the script, use the bash CLI to navigate to the directory where your script is located.

If you're on a Unix/Linux machine, open your terminal and use the `cd` command to move into your desired directory. For Windows users, you can use Git Bash to get similar functionality.
